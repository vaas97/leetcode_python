# Leetcode Problems by Vasu Davanagere
This is a repo containing some of my solutions to various Leetcode problems, written in Python.
I decided to solve these problems as I began learning Python.

I personally learn best through challenging myself to solve real problems,
so Leetcode was the perfect place for me to learn.

After solving a lot of these problems, especially the more challenging ones,
I feel I was able to apply a lot of my university classwork. I learned a
lot about many different algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc), data structures (lists,
dictionaries / maps, custom classes), and generally good coding practices.

I was also able to think about all the edge cases to the problems,
create test cases within Leetcode itself, and make sure that my code worked
for all the test cases. I also began developing unit tests in python itself.
You can take a look at most of my problems in this repo and see the unit tests.
